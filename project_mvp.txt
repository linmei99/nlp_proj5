                           NLP MVP

Design:
On many websites, people can leave behind comments, reviews to express their opinions. But who review the reviewers? How different are these reviews from each other?

This project is trying to quantify the quality of the reviews using NLP techniques. It group all reviews on a product into the most distinct group of reviews. So rather than reading through many similar reviews, the user can read the most distinct comments and avoid reading similar comments over and over again.

One comment will be regarded as sufficiently different another review on the same product if the cosine similarity is different by at least 0.3 


Data:
The primary data are amazon reviews on software. A total of 250,000 reviews on various software products are used as the data set.  

The reviews of the same product are grouped together. The positive review and the negative reviews are treated as different cluster to find distinct reviews.

The number of different clusters, or the number of sufficiently different reviews, versus the total number of actual reviews is used to describe the review diversity. For each cluster, one review is provided, instead of showing all the reviews.


Algorithms:

This project will use TF-IDF vectorlizer to generate the document term matrix. Then discover the main topics in all the reviews for all the products. Then the topics generated for all reviews are used to generate the cosine similarity for each reviews on the same product. 

A review for a particular porduct may not have certains topics, but the cosine similarity will still be generated by using the topics of the whole review.
